# House of Metal playlist generator
Generates a Spotify playlist with the participating artists for each year that the festival House of Metal (https://www.houseofmetal.se) has run in Ume√•/Sweden.

I'm not affiliated with House of Metal in any way, this was just created for fun.

How to run it:

1. Create an app using the Spotify Developer Dashboard (https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login)
2. Update the secrets.py file
3. Install the dependencies: **pip3 install -r requirements.txt**
4. Run the playlists.py script: **python3 playlists.py**
5. Copy the full URL (*localhost...*) that is opened in your web browser and paste it where the script asks for it
